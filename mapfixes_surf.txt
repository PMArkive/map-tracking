submitted fixes (no wipe):
5239078742 - One Day - fixed bumpy ramp and buggy unions coming in and out of existence - copylocked

add map data:
17143740888 - Dionysus - Fixed a ramp with a bad spine, made it possible to go through ring and enter endzone, changed startzone to spawn you in the main map instead of in a pitch black room.

submitted fixes need add map data:
569053285 - Sand Temple - now possible - delayed due to moving parts being bad

rejected fixes, additional fix notes:
10076918777 - Water Valley - Fixed bhopping on mountains (out of bound skip) - The player should never have to know where invisible walls are to run the map.  Perhaps make the mountain triggers instead.
16249264391 - Shard - Resized start zone to prevent height advantage from leaving and re entering start zone (Abusing times will be deleted manually) - changing position of mapstart will mess with bots..
2637387680 - Accident 2 - fixed halloween stage - blocked due to lighting fixer - use a Script with RunContext set to Client instead of a loader
